 - PathLogic shouldn't send a bot behind or through enemy creep waves. Instead rather go through the forest.
 - GetLifetime (for wards, illusions, etc)
 - PathLogic reset when bot moves out of range of current node (see forum post)
 - Kongor death event
 - CBotMetaDataNode:GetIndex - for debugging it may be handy to know the id of a node. Right now you need to save this in an additional property.
 - CBotMetaDataNode:GetLinkedNode(s) - a way to get nodes linked to eachother (via the link xml code)
 - A way to draw debug circles (like ability range indicators). This would be useful to display GetUnitsInRadius radius.
 - The removal or vast increase on the limit on line drawing so we can draw shapes like numbers useful for debugging (HoN.DrawDebugLine is currently capped at ~42 lines after which it ignores the function calls)
 - A way to get some sort of client time or ms since computer start (something like os.clock), this would allow to do simple profiling (local start = GetAccurateTime(); DoPotentiallySuboptimalTask(); Echo(GetAccurateTime() - start);)
 - IsAvailable for items to see if they are in stock (e.g. wards, right now we need to try to buy one and then see if gold changed to know if one was available, rather be able to know this in advance since then we can also use this knowledge to decide if we want to go to the Observatory). What might be better might be a GetNumPurchasable() that returns how many items we can buy with our gold and with the stock.
